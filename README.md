# PomodoroTimer App

Welcome to the PomodoroTimer App – your personal assistant to boost productivity using the time-tested Pomodoro Technique®.

## About PomodoroTimer

PomodoroTimer is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help you manage your time more effectively and increase your productivity. By breaking down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, followed by short breaks, the Pomodoro Technique® encourages you to work with the time you have—rather than against it.

## Features

- **Customizable Pomodoro Length:** Set your Pomodoro to last 25 minutes or any length that suits your work style.
- **Short & Long Breaks:** Enjoy a short break after each Pomodoro and a longer break after every set of four.
- **Task Management:** Keep track of your tasks and check them off as you complete each Pomodoro.
- **Notifications:** Receive alerts when it's time to start working or take a break to keep you on track.
- **Statistics:** View detailed reports of your Pomodoros and track your productivity over time.
- **Minimalist Design:** Stay focused with a clean and distraction-free interface.
